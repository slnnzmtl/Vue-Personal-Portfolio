This helps to quickly spot potential fires by identifying changes in temperature and the environment, and it sends immediate alerts to forest authorities for quick action.</p><img src=\"http://slnnzmtl.xyz/projects/smoke-alert-bot/image-2.jpg\" alt=\"image\"><p>The project is flexible and can be expanded, and ongoing improvements to the AI model make it more accurate.</p><img src=\"http://slnnzmtl.xyz/projects/smoke-alert-bot/image-1.jpg\" alt=\"image\"><p>This project highlights how technology can help protect the environment and prevent the damaging effects of forest fires on ecosystems and communities.</p><h2>Tech stack</h2><ul><li>Python</li><li>Telegram.ext</li></ul>",
